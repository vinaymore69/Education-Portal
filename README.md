## ⚙️ Installation & Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- PHP 7.4 or higher  
- MySQL or MariaDB server  
- Composer for PHP dependency management  
- Apache web server (XAMPP recommended for Windows)  

### Step-by-step Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinaymore69/Education-Portal.git
cd Education-Portal
```

2. **Install dependencies with Composer**

```bash
composer install
```

3. **Database Initialization**

- Create database `education_dashboard` (or your preferred name).
- Import provided SQL schema with tables: `users`, `students`, `semesters`, `marks`.
- Populate `users` with students (usernames = roll numbers) and teachers.
- Add semester entries (`semesters` table) like `sem1`, `sem2`, etc.

4. **Configure Database Connection**

- Edit `connection.php` with your database credentials.

5. **Start Apache server and access the portal**

Open your browser at:

```
http://localhost/Education-Portal/login.php
```

## 🎯 How to Use

### Teachers

- Login with teacher credentials.
- Access the **Marks Upload** page.
- Choose semester and upload the `.xlsx`, `.xls` or `.csv` marks file.
- System validates students and uploads marks with detailed error feedback.
- Errors include missing students, invalid roll numbers, or duplicate entries.

### Students

- Login with roll number as username.
- (Future scope) View marks and profile details.

---

## 💡 Upload File Format

Your Excel/CSV must have:

| roll_number | Subject1 | Subject2 | Subject3 | ... |

- First row: Header columns.
- Subsequent rows: Roll number and marks for each subject.

---

## 🔧 Developer Notes

- Passwords hashed via PHP’s `password_hash()` (bcrypt).
- Database queries use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
- Error handling on upload provides row-specific feedback.
- Students auto-created in `students` table if missing, based on roll_number.
- Foreign keys ensure database consistency, cascading deletes where applicable.

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Troubleshooting

| Issue                                    | Resolution                                                        |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Foreign key constraint errors             | Ensure student profiles exist before inserting marks. Auto-creation logic included in processor script. |
| File upload size or type restrictions      | Check `php.ini` settings for `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size`. Validate file formats `.xlsx, .xls, .csv`. |
| PhpSpreadsheet exceptions                  | Verify file integrity and format compliance.                     |
| Login failures or hashed password mismatch| Confirm password hashing during user creation matches login logic.|
| Missing dependencies                       | Run `composer install` and ensure `vendor/` folder exists.       |

---

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

- Student dashboard with mark summaries and profile editing.
- Admin interface for managing users and semesters.
- Email notifications on marks upload and account changes.
- Improved UI with modern frameworks (React, Vue, etc.).
- Multi-language support and accessibility improvements.
