# Education Portal

## Overview

Education Portal is a web-based application designed to manage academic activities including user authentication (students and teachers), semester-wise marks upload via Excel/CSV files, and a secure role-based system to maintain student records and marks efficiently.

This project uses PHP for backend processing, MySQL for database management, and PhpSpreadsheet library for Excel/CSV file handling.

---

## Features

- Role-based authentication: Students and Teachers with separate access.
- Upload student marks for different semesters through an Excel/CSV upload interface.
- Automatic linking of student marks with users and student profiles.
- Secure password hashing and session management.
- Database schema supporting users, students, semesters, and marks.
- Detailed error handling during marks upload.
- Support for multiple file formats: `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv`.
  
---

## Technology Stack

- Backend: PHP 7+  
- Database: MySQL / MariaDB  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic)  
- PHP Libraries: [PhpSpreadsheet](https://phpspreadsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for Excel/CSV parsing  
- Web Server: Apache (XAMPP or similar)  
- Version Control: Git + GitHub

## Database Schema

### users

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- PHP 7.4+ installed
- MySQL or MariaDB server running
- Composer installed (for PHP dependency management)
- Web server like Apache (XAMPP recommended for Windows)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vinaymore69/Education-Portal.git
   cd Education-Portal
````

2. Install PHP dependencies:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

   This installs PhpSpreadsheet and other required packages into the `vendor/` folder.

3. Setup the database:

   * Create a new database `education_dashboard` (or your preferred name).
   * Import the SQL schema (tables: `users`, `students`, `semesters`, `marks`).
   * Populate the `users` table with students and teachers (usernames should include roll numbers for students).
   * Populate the `semesters` table with semester names (sem1, sem2, etc.).
   * You may leave the `students` table empty; the app auto-creates entries when marks are uploaded.

4. Configure database connection:

   * Open `connection.php`
   * Set your MySQL hostname, username, password, and database name.

5. Start your web server and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost/Education-Portal/login.php
   ```

   Login with your teacher or student credentials.

---

## Usage

### Teacher

* Login as a teacher.

* Navigate to the "Upload Marks" page.

* Select the semester.

* Upload an Excel or CSV file with the following columns (header row):

  \| roll\_number | subject1 | subject2 | ... |

* Submit to process and save marks.

* Errors such as missing students or invalid data will be displayed.

### Student

* Login as a student.
* (Future enhancement: View marks and profile details.)

## File Descriptions

| File                          | Purpose                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `login.php`                   | Handles user login and session creation    |
| `logout.php`                  | Ends user session and redirects to login   |
| `teacher_upload_marks.php`    | Form for teachers to upload marks file     |
| `teacher_marks_processor.php` | Backend logic to parse file and save marks |
| `connection.php`              | Database connection script                 |
| `vendor/`                     | Composer packages including PhpSpreadsheet |

---

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

* **Fatal errors related to foreign keys:**
  Ensure the student exists in `students` table before marks insertion. The processor script auto-inserts student profiles if missing.

* **File upload errors:**
  Check PHP settings: `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` in `php.ini`.

* **Permission errors:**
  Make sure the `vendor/` folder and all project files have the correct read permissions.

* **PhpSpreadsheet exceptions:**
  Ensure the uploaded file format is supported (.xlsx, .xls, .csv) and properly formatted.

* **Login problems:**
  Passwords are hashed using bcrypt. Use the registration or manual DB insertion to add users.

---

## Security Considerations

* Passwords are stored hashed using PHP’s `password_hash()` function.
* Session-based authentication with role checks to restrict access.
* File upload validations to accept only allowed file types.
* Prepared statements used for all database queries to prevent SQL Injection.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Student dashboard to view marks and profile.
* Admin panel for user and semester management.
* Email notifications for marks upload.
* Enhanced form validation and UI improvements.
* Pagination and search for large student/marks lists.
